## **Overview**

I am a **Data Governance Analyst** with experience designing governance frameworks, building automated data quality solutions, and delivering analytics-driven business impact across enterprise and financial services environments.

This portfolio is intentionally designed to:

- Communicate **quantified impact** (cost savings, efficiency gains, scale)
- Demonstrate **technical fluency** beyond slideware and dashboards
- Reflect how I approach **trusted data foundations** in real-world environments

The site is built as a modern single-page application to mirror how I design production-quality data solutions: **structured, maintainable, and outcome-focused**.

## **Technical Stack**

This portfolio itself is built using:

- **Frontend:** React + Vite  
- **Styling:** Custom CSS (animation- and performance-focused)  
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions  
- **Tooling:** GitHub, npm, modern ES modules

## **Why This Exists**

Recruiters often see:

- resumes without sufficient technical context, or  
- dashboards without explanation of business impact  

This portfolio bridges that gap by pairing **technical execution** with **business narrative**—the same way effective data governance must operate within an organization.
