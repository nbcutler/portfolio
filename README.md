This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, which highlights my professional experience, technical skill set, and measurable impact across data governance, analytics, and automation initiatives.

Overview

I am a Data Governance Analyst with experience designing governance frameworks, building automated data quality solutions, and delivering analytics-driven business impact across financial services and enterprise environments.

This portfolio is intentionally designed to:

Communicate quantified impact (cost savings, efficiency gains, scale)

Demonstrate technical fluency beyond slideware

Reflect how I think about trusted data foundations in practice

The site is built as a modern single-page application to mirror how I approach production-quality data solutions: structured, maintainable, and outcome-focused.

What You’ll Find
📊 Impact & Metrics

Concrete examples of business value delivered, including:

$2M+ annual savings from data architecture and quality improvements

💼 Professional Experience

Highlights from roles at:

TIAA — Data Governance Analyst

DriveTime — Marketing Data Analyst

Each role emphasizes decision impact, not just responsibilities.

🚀 Projects

Selected academic and professional projects demonstrating:

Forecasting & optimization

Experimental design and A/B testing

Large-scale data analysis and visualization

Leadership in technical team environments

Technical Stack

This portfolio itself is built using:

Frontend: React + Vite

Styling: Custom CSS (animation- and performance-focused)

Deployment: GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions

Tooling: GitHub, npm, modern ES modules

The codebase reflects clean component structure, state-driven UI updates, and production-style deployment practices.

Why This Exists

Recruiters often see:

resumes without context, or

dashboards without explanation

This portfolio bridges that gap by pairing technical execution with business narrative—the same way effective data governance work must operate within an organization.
